	<h2>Steps:</h2>
	<h4>Preparing the Broth:</h4>

	</ul>
	<h4>Preparing Toppings:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Chashu:</b> Slice the chashu into thin pieces. You can either make your own by slow-cooking pork belly or use pre-made options from the store.</li>
    	<li><b>Soft-Boiled Eggs:</b> If desired, marinate soft-boiled eggs in soy sauce or your preferred marinade for extra flavor. Slice them in half when serving.</li>
    	<li><b>Other Toppings:</b> Slice scallions, prepare bamboo shoots, nori sheets, bean sprouts, and any other toppings you like.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Assembling the Ramen:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Bowl It:</b> Place the cooked noodles in a serving bowl.</li>
    	<li><b>Ladle the Broth:</b> Carefully pour the hot broth over the noodles. Ensure the broth covers the noodles.</li>
    	<li><b>Add Toppings:</b> Arrange the chashu, soft-boiled egg halves, sliced scallions, bamboo shoots, nori, bean sprouts, and any other toppings you prepared on top of the noodles.</li>
		<li><b>Garnish:</b> Drizzle a little sesame oil, and add a pinch of sesame seeds (if desired). You can also add minced fresh garlic and a dash of rice vinegar for extra flavor.</li>
    	<li><b>Serve Hot:</b> Ramen is best when served hot. Enjoy your homemade ramen!</li>
