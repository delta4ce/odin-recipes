	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Onigiri, often referred to as "rice balls" or "rice triangles," is a traditional and popular Japanese food. Onigiri consists of cooked rice that is shaped into a compact, often triangular or cylindrical form and is typically wrapped in a sheet of nori (seaweed). These tasty and portable treats are found in many Japanese households, bento boxes, and convenience stores, making them a convenient and versatile snack or meal option.</p>
	<h2>Key Components of Onigiri:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Rice:</b> The primary ingredient is Japanese short-grain rice. This rice is typically steamed and sometimes mixed with seasonings like salt and rice vinegar to enhance the flavor. The rice serves as the base and gives onigiri its distinctive texture.</li>
		<li>
			<b>Fillings:</b> Onigiri can have a variety of fillings, and these fillings are often placed at the center of the rice ball. Some common fillings include:
			<ul>
				<li>Umeboshi (pickled plum): Provides a tart and salty flavor.</li>
				<li>Katsuobushi (bonito flakes): Adds a smoky and umami taste.</li>
				<li>Tarako (salted cod or pollock roe): Offers a creamy and salty flavor.</li>
				<li>Teriyaki chicken, vegetables, or other ingredients: Adds savory or sweet elements.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Nori:</b> Sheets of nori (seaweed) are used to wrap the onigiri. Nori adds a layer of texture, flavor, and helps hold the rice ball together. The nori can be plain or seasoned.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Preparation:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Start by preparing a bowl of sushi rice. This rice is typically stickier than regular rice, making it easier to shape into onigiri.</li>
		<li>Wet your hands with water to prevent the rice from sticking to your fingers. You can also lightly salt your hands for extra flavor.</li>
		<li>Take a small portion of rice in your hand, and gently press it into a flat, oval shape. If you're adding a filling, place it in the center of the rice.</li>
		<li>Cup your hand and shape the rice around the filling, creating a triangular or cylindrical form.</li>
		<li>If using nori, wrap it around the rice, covering it completely. The nori will stick to the rice due to its natural stickiness when moistened.</li>
	</ol>
